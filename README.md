# Design Patterns Mnemonic Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a mnemonic to help remember key design patterns, categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns. Each pattern is briefly described along with a mnemonic to facilitate recall.

| **Category**      | **Pattern**        | **Usage**                                                                                      | **Mnemonic**                |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Creational**    | Abstract Factory   | Create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes      | Architect family objects    |
|                   | Factory Method     | Create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created           | Forge objects               |
|                   | Builder            | Construct a complex object step by step                                                        | Build step by step          |
|                   | Prototype          | Create new instances of objects that are identical to existing ones                            | Painting a clone            |
|                   | Singleton          | Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it                | Single instance             |
| **Structural**    | Decorator          | Add responsibilities to objects dynamically                                                    | Dress up                    |
|                   | Adapter            | Convert one interface to another so that it matches what a client expects                      | Adapt the plug              |
|                   | Facade             | Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem                              | Front desk                  |
|                   | Bridge             | Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently          | Build a bridge              |
|                   | Proxy              | Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it                  | Placeholder proxy           |
|                   | Composite          | Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies                       | Compose a tree              |
|                   | Flyweight          | Minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects           | Prudent memory              |
| **Behavioral**    | Strategy           | Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable             | Switch strategies           |
|                   | Observer           | Notify other objects about state changes                                                       | Observe and notify          |
|                   | Memento            | Capture and restore an object's internal state without violating encapsulation                 | Memory capsule              |
|                   | Command            | Encapsulate a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations | Control commands    |
|                   | Iterator           | Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation | Iterate sequentially |
|                   | Template Method    | Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses             | Template for tasks          |
|                   | Visitor            | Define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates        | Visit elements              |
|                   | State              | Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes                           | State-based behavior        |
|                   | Chain of Responsibility | Pass a request along a chain of handlers, allowing each handler to either handle the request or pass it to the next handler | Send along the chain  |
|                   | Mediator           | Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling      | Central mediator            |
